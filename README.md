A powerful, all-in-one PowerShell GUI toolkit for cleaning and managing Windows 10/11 systems. Easily remove bloatware like Edge and OneDrive, reset the icon cache, find/kill processes locking a folder, and toggle an annoying Defender privacy setting/notification.

## Features

This toolkit combines several powerful scripts into a single, user-friendly interface with three main sections:

#### 1. System Cleanup
- **Permanently Remove Microsoft Edge:** Forcefully uninstalls the Edge browser, its services, and scheduled tasks.
- **Permanently Remove OneDrive:** Uninstalls the OneDrive client, removes it from the File Explorer sidebar, and blocks reinstallation.

#### 2. System Tools
- **Reset Icon Cache:** A quick tool to fix corrupted or broken desktop and folder icons by clearing the cache and restarting Explorer.
- **Toggle Defender Privacy:** A reversible tweak to enable or disable the annoying notificiations when "Automatic sample submission" is turned off in Windows Defender.

#### 3. Folder Unlocker
- **Find & Kill Locking Processes:** Select a folder to identify which processes are currently using files within it.
- **Force-Close Handles:** Forcefully terminate all identified processes to unlock the folder, allowing it to be moved or deleted.
